# Adult Census Income Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Adult Census Income dataset to uncover insights into the income distribution among various demographic and employment factors.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains detailed information about adults, including:

- Age
- Work Class
- Final Weight
- Education
- Education Number
- Marital Status
- Occupation
- Relationship
- Race
- Sex
- Capital Gain
- Capital Loss
- Hours per Week
- Native Country
- Income (<=50K, >50K)

## Data Preprocessing
Key steps taken to prepare the data for analysis:

- Renaming columns for consistency and readability.
- Handling missing values by replacing '?' with 'Not Available'.
- Creating a cleaned dataset for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key areas explored:

- Age Distribution: Analysis of age groups. Minimum age is 17, maximum age is 90, 
  and average age is 38.6.
- Income Distribution: Examination of income levels. More people are making less 
  than or equal to $50K (7,025) compared to those making above $50K (3,680).
- Education Level: Distribution of different education levels. Most common 
  education level is High School graduation (3,224 people).
- Occupation Analysis: Relationship between occupation and income.
- Gender Analysis: Income distribution by gender.
- Income Ratio by Age Group: The age group 46-60 has the highest proportion of 
  high earners compared to low earners, while the 17-30 age group has the lowest 
  proportion of high earners.

## Advanced Data Analysis
Performed advanced analysis to uncover deeper insights:

- Income by Work Class: Analysis of income distribution across different work 
  classes.
- Gender and Income: Examined income distribution by gender. Found more income 
  inequality, with a significant majority earning <=50K.
- Marital Status and Income: Individuals who are married are more likely to earn 
  more than $50K compared to those who are not. This could be linked to various 
  socio-economic factors, such as shared financial responsibilities and household 
  income dynamics.
- Race and Income: Analysis of income distribution by race.
- Hours Worked per Week: Average hours worked per week across different work 
  classes. Minimum hours worked is 1 hour, and maximum is 99 hours.
- Capital Gain/Loss by Income: Individuals earning more than $50K have higher 
  average capital gains compared to those earning less. This could indicate that 
  higher earners are more likely to invest and receive returns on their 
  investments.
- Age by Education Level: Average, minimum, and maximum age for each education 
  level.
- Country of Origin and Income: Income distribution based on native country.
- High Earners by Education Level: Among those earning more than $50K, 
  individuals with a Bachelor's degree are the most common, suggesting a strong 
  correlation between higher education levels and higher income.
- Marital Status and Income Level: The data shows that individuals who are 
  married are more likely to earn more than $50K.
- Occupational Insights: The "Executive Managerial" occupation category has the 
  highest number of individuals earning more than $50K, indicating that 
  managerial roles are associated with higher income levels.
- Hours Worked per Week and Income: A significant number of individuals working 
  around 40 hours per week are earning both more than $50K and less than or 
  equal to $50K.

## Dashboard in Tableau
A comprehensive dashboard has been created in Tableau to visualize the key insights. The dashboard includes:

- Age Distribution: Histogram of age groups.
- Income by Occupation: Bar chart showing the count of income levels per 
  occupation.
- Education Level: Bar chart showing the count of each education level.
- Gender and Income: Stacked bar chart showing income distribution by gender.
- Work Class and Income: Heatmap showing the correlation between work class and 
  income levels.
- Income Ratio by Age Group: A bar chart or pie chart illustrating the income 
  ratio across different age groups.
- High Earners by Education Level: A chart showing the distribution of 
  individuals earning more than $50K by their highest level of education.
- Marital Status and Income: A visualization comparing income levels across 
  different marital statuses.
- Income Distribution by Hours Worked: A chart showing the distribution of 
  income based on the number of hours worked per week.
